# Quantum-Cryptography
Here is my Physics degree's final project (TFG) about Quantum Cryptography. 
Throughout history, humanity has developed increasingly sophisticated encryption methods to keep information secure; but along with them, the way to break them is also advancing. The development of Quantum Mechanics in the early part of the XX century, made Classical Cryptography unstable
and the publication of Shorâ€™s Algorithm made it definitively clear that the power of Quantum Computers would easily break its security. Hence, the need to develop new algorithms for encryption and resistant keys generation: Quantum Cryptography arrives. This project will focus on studying its foundations and then, applying them to the best-known Quantum Key Distribution protocol, BB84. It will also analyse the possible attacks and how it is carried out experimentally. Thus, we should not consider it as something futuristic because it is already a reality.
